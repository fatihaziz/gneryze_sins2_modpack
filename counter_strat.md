To effectively counter different types of ships with a total of 300 supply slots, consider the following ratios of mainline ships and counters:

### Heavy Cruiser Spam

- **Ratio**: 5 Heavy Cruisers, 5 Tempest Frigates
- **Counter Components**:
  - Heavy Cruisers for direct combat
  - Tempest Frigates for additional maneuverability and support

### Capital Ship Spams

- **Ratio**: 3 Capital Ships, 5 Light Frigates, 2 Gauss Frigates
- **Counter Components**:
  - Capital Ships for front-line damage
  - Light Frigates for support and flexibility
  - Gauss Frigates for anti-capital measures

### Missile-Based Army

- **Ratio**: 4 Gauss Frigates, 6 PD Ships (like Flak Frigates), 5 Light Frigates
- **Counter Components**:
  - Gauss Frigates to focus fire on missile launchers
  - PD Ships to handle incoming missiles
  - Light Frigates for backup

### Carrier and Support Ship Focus

- **Ratio**: 4 Light Frigates, 3 Heavy Cruisers, 3 PD Ships
- **Counter Components**:
  - Light Frigates for quick maneuvers
  - Heavy Cruisers for taking down larger ships
  - PD Ships to guard against fighters/bombers

### General Balanced Fleet

- **Ratio**: 3 Heavy Cruisers, 4 Light Frigates, 3 Tempest Frigates, 3 Gauss Frigates
- **Counter Components**:
  - Heavy Cruisers and Light Frigates for balance
  - Tempest Frigates for adaptability
  - Gauss Frigates for specialized threats

### Additional Tips:

- Always include some PD Ships if expecting missile-based threats.
- Use Tempest Frigates for greater flexibility against predictable frigate formations.
- Combine Heavy Cruisers with supporting frigates for robust engagements.

To counter different types of ships with a 300 supply slot limit, consider the following ratios based on the given unit counters:

1. **Heavy Cruisers:**
   
   - 100 supply in Gauss Frigates (to counter Tempest Frigates)
   - 100 supply in Missile Frigates/Cruisers (to counter Heavy Cruisers and complement Gauss Frigates)
   - 100 supply in Light Frigates (for versatility and to support against Corvette attacks)

2. **Corvettes:**
   
   - 150 supply in Heavy Cruisers (strong vs Corvettes)
   - 50 supply in Light Frigates (for balance and additional power)
   - 100 supply in Gauss Frigates (for multi-target capability)

3. **Tempest Frigates:**
   
   - 150 supply in Heavy Cruisers (strong counter to Tempest Frigates)
   - 75 supply in Light Frigates (support and secondary counters)
   - 75 supply in Corvette units (to circle and harass effectively)

4. **Capital Ships:**
   
   - 150 supply in Heavy Cruisers (best against capital ships)
   - 100 supply in Gauss Frigates (to cover against missile threats and support)
   - 50 supply in Missile Frigates/Cruisers (for additional firepower)

5. **General Fleet:**
   
   - 100 supply in Heavy Cruisers (versatile and strong backbone)
   - 100 supply in Gauss Frigates (strong counters and general use)
   - 50 supply in Light Frigates (flexibility and energy)
   - 50 supply in Corvettes (mobility and harassment)

Adjust these ratios according to your strategic needs and the specific enemy fleet composition you are facing. Consider adding point defense ships strategically where missiles are a key threat.
